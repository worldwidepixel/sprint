# Sprint
This is sprint. A mod for Legacy Fabric which makes it easier to sprint.
## What does it do?
On older versions of the game, you need to double-tap W to be able to run. This mod changes it so you can hold or trigger ``Ctrl``, or any key you set the keybind to be.
## How can I use it?
Download the matching release for your Minecraft version from the releases tab and put it in your mods folder.
Reminder that you *must* use LegacyFabric, and not Forge.
